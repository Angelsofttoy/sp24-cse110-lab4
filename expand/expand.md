1. Some JavaScript developers believe that most of the issues with JavaScript stem from its asynchronous nature, its loose typing, and the web platform it runs on. For each of the three reasons listed, explain in your own words why a developer might believe that it is a pain point.

 + The loose typing feature may cause major problem to many websites which are built on the foundations of taking in user input. If the developer did not carefully cast the input type to the correct ones the function needs to use, the functionality of the whole website may fail dramatically. 

2. Related to the first question, why do you believe that the developer(s) who created JavaScript made it loosely typed? Why do you think they added asynchronous features?
 + Despite it being a major pain, but loose typing would help to guess user's intended input at the maximum extent. In addition, the asynchronous feature allow multiple things to run at the same time efficiently. 

3. What are the key differences between a compiled language and an interpreted one? Which one is JavaScript? What are the benefits & drawbacks of JavaScript being made that way?
+ JavaScript is definitely the interpreted one. This gives JavaScript higher degree of freedom in case of varible types, but instead made debugging harder because of its flexible type cnversion. 

4. The professor believes that, though sometimes misused, JavaScript frameworks are incredibly powerful tools that can help teams work more efficiently and effectively. Given that, why do you believe he is focusing more on vanilla JavaScript for this course? What are the benefits of mastering vanilla JS first? What are the drawbacks of not learning a framework?
+ This is because it has the potential to include lots of interactivity in website buildin. Learning such a framework could prevent the drawback of relying on library to build usable functions/functionality. 

5. Explain, in your own words, how you think this lab relates to your project. How might you be able to use this information in your own project?
+ I think overall, we got introduced to the major types of the JavaScript and aquired a preliminary understanding to its feature and mechanism through answering questions and debugging. This will definitely help when building the interactive part of our website in our group project. 
+ In addition the draw.io would really help us in creating a workflow prior to starting the process, making the procedure clear so there won't be any confusions in the middle of the building process.
